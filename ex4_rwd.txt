                <p>
                We believe that we are on the face of the earth to make great products and that's not changing. 
                We are constantly focusing on innovating. We believe in the simple not the complex. 
                We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make,
                and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution. 
                We believe in saying no to thousands of projects, 
                so that we can really focus on the few that are truly important and meaningful to us. 
                We believe in deep collaboration and cross-pollination of our groups, which allow us to innovate in a way that others cannot. 
                And frankly, we don't settle for anything less than excellence in every group in the company, and we have the self-honesty to 
                admit when we're wrong and the courage to change. 
                And I think regardless of who is in what job those values are so embedded in this company that Apple will do extremely well."- 
                Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Computer

                <p>
                Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. 
                It was here where Starbucks opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, 
                tea and spices from around the world for our customers to take home. Our name was inspired by the classic tale, 
                “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.<br/>

                Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk through these doors and become 
                captivated with Starbucks coffee from his first sip. After joining the company in 1982, a different 
                cobblestone road would lead him to another discovery. 
                It was on a trip to Milan in 1983 that Howard first experienced Italy’s coffeehouses, and he returned to Seattle inspired to 
                bring the warmth and artistry of its coffee culture to Starbucks. By 1987, we swapped our brown aprons for green ones 
                and embarked on our next chapter as a coffeehouse.<br/>
                
                Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver, Canada and then on to California, 
                Washington, D.C. and New York. By 1996, we would cross the Pacific to open our first store in Japan, 
                followed by Europe in 1998 and China in 1999. Over the next two decades, we would grow to welcome 
                millions of customers each week and become a part of the fabric of tens of thousands of neighborhoods 
                all around the world. In everything we do, we are always dedicated to Our Mission: to inspire and nurture 
                the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.
